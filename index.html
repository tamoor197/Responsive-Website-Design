                <div class="faq-body">
                    TOR is basically an internet networking tool that allows its users to enjoy the opportunity of safe Internet browsing. It hides your online identity in a way that:
                    <br><br>Prevents others from tracking what activities or sites you visit online,                  
                    <br><br>Also, it prevents sites from knowing your physical location.
                    <br><br>Tor is useful for anyone who wants to keep their internet activities private. Also, with the help of this tool, you can access any website you want without any difficulty. The users can access dark web content easily by using the Tor browser. It is considered to be one of the easiest ways to browse the web anonymously.

            </h3>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    TOR does not give a complete guarantee of anonymity because it also has several limitations. However, it is the best possible solution we have currently.  But, there are different ways by which you can increase your chances of anonymity like:
                    <br><br>Use VPN with Tor                   
                    <br><br>VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a tool used to increase your privacy over the web. It hides your IP address thus no third party can track you. Thus, it is a very good solution to increase your anonymity if you use Tor with VPN. In this case, VPN will act as an additional shield from outside parties to trace your identity in any way.               
                    <br><br>Use software specifically configured for Tor        
                    <br>Tor does not protect all internet traffic at all. It only protects the applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor. In other words, for web browsing:       
                    <br><br>Don't Torrent over Tor             
                    <br><br>Torrent is basically used for peer-to-peer sharing or downloading large files like movies, shows, etc. Torrent file-sharing applications have been observed to ignore proxy settings and make direct connections even when they are told to use Tor. Thus, it is better not to perform Torrent file-sharing as it is risky and can make your IP address visible.          
                    <br><br>Use HTTPS version of websites   
                    <br><br>The websites you visit matter a lot. There are many websites present online but all of them are not end-to-end encrypted. As Tor is basically used for anonymity purposes, thus the users are advised to perform their online activities wisely. So when visiting any website, make sure that includes HTTP:// in their URL because they are considered to be the safest and most encrypted sites available.

                <div class="faq-body">
                    Yes, you can use VPN with Tor. VPN is a powerful tool that allows you to perform multiple activities like access to restricted sites and hiding your IP address so no one can track you. Thus using them together will provide you with an extra layer of security over the web. 
                    <br><br>Tor over VPN
                    <br>One of the methods to use Tor and VPN is "Tor over VPN” also called "Onion over VPN". With this method, the user connects to a VPN first and later accesses the Tor network through it.
                    <br><br>VPN over Tor
                    <br>The second method that can be used in combining these privacy tools is using a "VPN over Tor"  also called "VPN over Onion". Tor network is connected first and then a VPN.

                <div class="faq-body">
                    TOR browser conceals your online identity better than other browsers. It hides your IP address that will make others track your activities performed online. Thus, your requests placed online are passed through different processes to make this happen.
                    <br><br>Your traffic bouncing through volunteers  computers in different parts of the world is a time-consuming task. It is believed that while using TOR, your query is processed through three TOR network relays called nodes to ensure that your identity is hidden in the best possible way. These are some of the reasons for the slow speed of Tor browsers.
